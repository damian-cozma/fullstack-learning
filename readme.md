# fullstack-learning

To enhance my Python learning journey, I plan to build a web app using either Flask or Django. Since I want to create a high-quality website, I'm also learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with other frameworks.

## Resources Used

- **W3Schools**: For fundamental concepts and practical examples.
- **Codecademy**: For interactive lessons and real-world projects.
- **roadmap.sh**: To follow a structured learning path.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a journal of my learning process. I'll document everything I encounter, from basic exercises to more complex projects. My goal is to thoroughly understand full-stack development as I progress through a comprehensive course, covering both front-end and back-end technologies.
